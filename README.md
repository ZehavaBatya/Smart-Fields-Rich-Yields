# Smart-Fields-Rich-Yields

Problem description: In the agricultural industry, characterized by intense competition, there exists a critical deficiency in comprehensive indicators designed to enhance the efficiency and outcomes of the crop lifecycle, encompassing the stages of planting, growing, and harvesting. The absence of robust metrics and benchmarks hinders farmers and stakeholders from making informed decisions, thereby limiting the industry's potential for optimization and sustainable growth. This lack of indicators not only jeopardizes individual farm productivity but also poses a broader challenge to the industry's ability to adapt to evolving demands and advancements in agricultural practices. Addressing this deficiency is paramount for fostering innovation, improving resource management, and ensuring the long-term viability of the agricultural sector.

How the solution will be used:

Model Development:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data pertaining to the crop lifecycle, including planting, growing, and harvesting phases. This dataset should encompass diverse variables such as weather conditions, soil quality, irrigation practices, and historical crop performance.

Feature Engineering: Identify and preprocess key features within the dataset that significantly influence the crop lifecycle.

Model Training: Utilize machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model capable of analyzing the dataset and making accurate predictions related to crop outcomes.

Evaluation and Tuning: Assess the model's performance using validation datasets, and fine-tune parameters to optimize predictive accuracy and reliability.

# Docker
Build Docker Image:
Build the Docker image by executing the following command. This command creates an image named churn-flask-app.

bash
Copy code
docker build -t churn-flask-app .
Check Available Images:
View the available Docker images using the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker images
Run Docker Container:
Launch a Docker container with the Flask app using the following command. The container will run in detached mode, interactively, and will be automatically removed when stopped. Additionally, it maps port 9696 on the host to port 9696 in the container.

bash
Copy code
docker run -d --rm -p 9696:9696 --name my-flask-container churn-flask-app
List Running Containers:
Display a list of running containers along with their ports using the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker ps -a
Stop Docker Container:
Stop the running container named my-flask-container using the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker stop my-flask-container
